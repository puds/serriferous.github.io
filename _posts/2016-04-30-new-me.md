&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now it's just eyeliner, concealer (eye bags sigh) and bronzer for special occasions a few days a years. Laziness trumps vanity I suppose...<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I used to be at peace with my natural look. Not that I thought I looked good, far from it actually. I just never felt a need to do anything about it. Why doll myself up knowing it wouldn't give me internal peace. For external acceptance, to temporarily fill an empty void of insecurities? And what if it wasn't just filling the empty cavity but making it bigger? I was conflicted, wanting to feel good about myself but not wanting to derive it from others.<br>
