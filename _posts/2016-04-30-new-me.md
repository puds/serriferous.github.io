&nbsp;So, I've never really been one to understand make up, or contouring. Never put on lipstick. Never had my brows done, or drawn them. Now it's just eyeliner, concealer (eye bags sigh) and bronzer for special occasions. Laziness trumps vanity I suppose...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I used to be at peace with my natural look. Not that I thought I looked good, far from it actually. I just never felt a need to do anything about it. Why doll myself up for others, for their acceptance, to temporarily fill my empty void of insecurities. And who's to say this wasn't just filling the empty cavity but making it bigger. I was conflicted, wanting to feel good about myself but not wanting to derive it from others.<br>
