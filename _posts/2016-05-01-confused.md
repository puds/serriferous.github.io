Spent all day, and then all night, <br>
Thinking about how this conversation doesn't matter. <br>
About how both our words are inconsequential. <br>
You have changed. <br>
I have changed. <br>
Sustenance taking the form of memories and recounted feelings.<br>
<br>

It seems we are <br>
in the present<br>
questioning the future<br>
buried under our past<br>
