Not very pleased that I haven't had the time/energy to continue working on this site, or write actual poems/prose :-(
<br><br>
Then again there's many things that're piling up now, particularly the backlog of machine learning and data analytics online courses and books still left untouched...

<br><br>
In any case, work has (relatively) good this week. I suppose it's the company, as in, the <i>company</i>. Feels like an actual team here at CR, albeit mb I'm not technically part of this team. But it feels sorta like it did a year ago again. <br><br>

Despite that, I'm not exactly sure why, but I haven't gotten good rest this entire week, constantly waking up at 4am and drifting in and out... Feeling very lethargic though Idk why... Trying not to think about the things that worry me I guess, but sometimes they just appear anw. <br><br>
Nonetheless, still very thankful and hopeful in the Lord for everything so far, and everything to be.
