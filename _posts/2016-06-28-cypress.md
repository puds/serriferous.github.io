Back to back meetings from 9AM - 8PM<br>

Woke up at 630AM<br><br>
Couldn't sleep.

"You’re the ones who can’t find peace within yourself. Who have always wanted to try harder, run faster, push yourself further than the world around you ever expected you to go. You’re the ones with the expectations so high that even you can never live up to yourself. Even you can sometimes find your mind to be ‘too much’ for your body."
