I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.<br><br>
This tremendous world I hav einside of me. How to free myself, and this world, without tearing myself to pieces. And rather tear myself to a thousand pieces than be buried with this world within me.<br>
<br>
There is an infinite amount of hope in the universe;<br>
but not for us.<br><br>
<br>
Abandoning this github, in search of hopeful abandon, total abandon. Abandon. To give up completely / with complete lack of inhibition and restraint. Moving back to Medium. <br>Bye.
