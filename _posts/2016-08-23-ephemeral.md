I cannot make you understand.<br>I cannot make anyone understand <br>what is happening inside me. <br>I cannot even explain it <br>to myself.<br><br>
This tremendous world I have inside of me. <br>How to free myself, and this world, <br>without tearing myself to pieces. <br>And rather tear myself <br>to a thousand pieces <br>than be buried with this world within me.<br>
<br>
There is an infinite amount of hope in the universe;<br>
but not for us.<br><br>
<br>
Abandoning this github, in search of hopeful abandon, <br>total abandon. <br>Abandon. <br>To give up completely <br>/ with complete lack of inhibition and restraint. <br>Moving back to Medium. <br><br>Bye.
